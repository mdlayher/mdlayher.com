## Hello!

I'm Matt, and I'm a Staff Engineer at [Fastly](https://fastly.com),
working remotely from Kalamazoo, MI. My primary interests include Linux,
computer networking, distributed systems, open source software, and the Go
programming language.

Open source software is my true passion, and I have authored and published
a number of projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdlayher) which have seen
wide adoption. In addition, I am regularly involved with the following open
source projects:

- [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/)
  - commit access, focused on [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/),
  [x/net](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net), and
  [x/sys/unix](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix)
- [the Prometheus metrics and monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/)
  - former team member
- [the WireGuard VPN tunnel project](https://www.wireguard.com/)
  - maintainer of [wgctrl-go](https://github.com/WireGuard/wgctrl-go)

I enjoy authoring [blog posts](/blog) and [giving presentations](/#talks) about
technical content at both meetups and conferences, including GopherCon and
KubeCon/Cloud Native Con. You can also find me [live-streaming](https://twitch.tv/mdlayher)
Go and networking projects on Twitch, or catch a [recording of a stream](https://www.youtube.com/c/mattlayher)
on YouTube! I see these opportunities as a great challenge and as a force
multiplier: by sharing my knowledge with others, we are able to achieve more
together than I ever could on my own.

Some of my non-technology hobbies include [craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/mdlayher),
whiskey, exercise, food, and music. It's always nice to take a break from computers
and enjoy some time away with friends and family!
