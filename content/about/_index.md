My name is Matt Layher, and I am a Software Engineer at [Fastly](https://fastly.com),
working remotely from Kalamazoo, MI. My primary interests include Linux,
computer networking, distributed systems, open source software, and the Go
programming language.

I am a strong believer in open source software, and have authored and published
a number of projects on [GitHub](https://github.com/mdlayher) which have seen
wide adoption. In addition, I am regularly involved with the following open
source projects:

- [the Go programming language](https://golang.org/)
  - commit access, focused on [net](https://golang.org/pkg/net/),
  [x/net](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/net), and
  [x/sys/unix](https://godoc.org/golang.org/x/sys/unix)
- [the Prometheus metrics and monitoring system](https://prometheus.io/)
  - team member, focused on [node_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter)

I enjoy authoring [blog posts](/blog) about technical content, and I am a
regular [public speaker](/#talks) at both meetups and conferences, including
GopherCon and KubeCon/Cloud Native Con. I see these opportunities as a great
challenge and as a force multiplier: by sharing my knowledge with others, we are
able to achieve more together than I ever could on my own.

Some of my non-technology hobbies include [craft beer](https://untappd.com/user/mdlayher),
bourbon, exercise, food, and music. It's always nice to take a break from computers
and enjoy some time away with friends and family!
